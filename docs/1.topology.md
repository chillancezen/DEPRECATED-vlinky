In my solution ,there will be multiple device and link which will be inter-connnected within my design, so we do some abstraction about this architecture 
- vport :this is a physical link on which a pseudo wire will be deployed in a system. 
- domain:this is the lan domain  to which the vports who has the same broadcast domain belong. 
- device:usually a node in the physical topology
